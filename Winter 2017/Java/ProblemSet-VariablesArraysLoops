#### Short questions

Determine if each of the following is true or false, and in either case, explain your reasoning.

- `int` is a __reference__ variable type.
- You can use the - operator (subtraction) on a String to achieve __concatenation__.
- Primitive types are __numerical__ types.
- A __method__ is the top-level container of our code.
- A __class__ must always have the same name as the file it is in.

#### Code analysis question

Errors are present in the following snippet of code. Find, identify and correct those errors. Make sure to be able to justify why they are errors.

```java
public class HelloClass {

  public void main(String[] arg) {
    INT a = 1
    double b = 2;
    
    System.out.println('a + b = ' + (a + b));
    
    String = "Hello, World";
    System.out.println(helloWorld);
  }

```

#### Programming questions

__Problem 1__

Put together a short program that will calculate the tax on the price of three items part of a single purchase, respectively priced at 15$, 10$ and 19$, given that the tax rate is 15%. You can start using this [stub]() if you aren't sure of how to start off. The output of your program should be printed nicely and as a full sentence.
